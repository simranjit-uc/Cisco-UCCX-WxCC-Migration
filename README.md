# Cisco UCCX to Webex Contact Center (WxCC) Configuration Migration Tool

This tool automates the migration of **Cisco Unified Contact Center Express (UCCX)** configurations to **Webex Contact Center (WxCC)**. It extracts UCCX data, transforms it into WxCC compatible format, and pushes the configuration into a WxCC tenant using Cisco's REST APIs.


## Project Overview

### Migration Flow:

1. **Extract**: Pulls configuration from UCCX using REST APIs and stores it in an Excel file.
2. **Transform**: Converts UCCX configuration to WxCC-compatible format and saves it in a new Excel file.
3. **Authenticate**: Performs OAuth 2.0 authentication with Cisco Webex APIs.
4. **Push**: Uploads configuration to WxCC tenant via REST APIs.


### File Structure

| File Name          | Purpose |
|--------------------|---------|
| `main.py`          | Entry point. Coordinates the overall workflow and calls other modules. |
| `CCX_Sheet.py`     | Connects to UCCX, extracts configuration using REST APIs, and saves it to `CCX-Details.xlsx`. |
| `WxCC_Sheet.py`    | Reads `CCX-Details.xlsx`, transforms data into WxCC format, and writes to `WxCC Details.xlsx`. |
| `WxCC.py`          | Pushes data from `WxCC Details.xlsx` to WxCC tenant via REST APIs. It also triggers OAuth via `Client_OAuth.py`. |
| `Client_OAuth.py`  | Manages OAuth 2.0 flow to obtain access token from Cisco. |
| `Web_Server.py`    | Local HTTP server listening on port `5963`. Captures redirect with `Auth Code` and `State` from Cisco's auth service. |


### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- Python libraries - Openpyxl, xmltodict
- Cisco UCCX with REST API access enabled
- WxCC tenant with API access and registered integration for OAuth
- A browser available for handling OAuth redirect

## Customization

### Environment Variables

You will need to create "Environment Variables" for the following

* CCX_INSTANCE : FQDN of on-prem UCCX instance
* CCX_TOKEN : Base64 value of the username/password combination of an account that has access to UCCX REST APIs
* WxCC_INSTANCE : FQDN of WxCC Tenant
* ORG_ID : WxCC Organization ID
* WxCC_CLIENT_ID : Client ID that you get when you register your app on `https://developer.webex-cx.com/my-apps`
* WxCC_CLIENT_SECRET : Client Secret value that you get when you register your app on `https://developer.webex-cx.com/my-apps`
* WxCC_AUTH_URL : Authorization URL you get after you have registered your app on `https://developer.webex-cx.com/my-apps`
* WxCC_TOKEN_URL : Set it to `https://webexapis.com/v1/access_token`
* WxCC_REDIRECT_URI : Set it to the URL where you want Cisco to redirect OAuth response. In the case of this example, it will be `https://localhost:5963`

---

## How to Run

**1. Clone the repository**
  ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/simranjit-uc/Cisco-UCCX-WxCC-Migration.git
  ```

> Ensure you whitelist `http://localhost:5963` as a valid **redirect URI** in your Cisco OAuth app settings.

**2. Start the Migration**
   ```bash
   cd Cisco-UCCX-WxCC-Migration
   ```
   ```bash
   python3 main.py
   ```

**3. Follow Prompts**

   The app will guide you through the following steps with step by step update:

  * Initiating OAuth via browser (token is returned via `Web_Server.py`)
  * Connecting to UCCX (via Basic Auth)
  * Generating `CCX-Details.xlsx`
  * Transforming to `WxCC Details.xlsx`
  * Uploading configuration to WxCC

## OAuth Flow (Explained)

1. `Main.py` calls `Client_OAuth.py` to start the OAuth process.
2. `Client_OAuth.py`:

   * Opens a browser pointing to Cisco OAuth URL.
   * Redirect URI is set to `http://localhost:5963`.
3. `Web_Server.py`:

   * Listens on port `5963` for incoming HTTP redirect from Cisco.
   * Captures `auth_code` and `state` values.
4. `Client_OAuth.py` exchanges `auth_code` for access/refresh tokens and returns them to `WxCC.py`.

> You must approve the authentication in the browser for the flow to complete.

## Output Files

* `CCX-Details.xlsx`: Raw UCCX configuration as extracted via API.
* `WxCC Details.xlsx`: Transformed configuration compatible with WxCC.

## Example Use Case

[![Watch the demo](https://img.youtube.com/vi/gK3W_2sHtIs/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gK3W_2sHtIs)

Click the image above to watch a walkthrough of the migration tool in action.

In the above sample use-case, we are migrating the following UCCX configuration for a typical "Telecom Company" to a WxCC tenant.

* 7 Applications
* 7 CSQs
* 7 Teams
* 9 Skills
* 31 Wrap-Up and Reason Codes
* 2 Phone books with 15 Contacts

The app does the following in less than a minute:

1. Extracts all 63 odd items from UCCX and logs them.
2. Transforms them into a WxCC compatible format.
3. Maps Teams, CSQs and Skills to WxCC Team, Queue and Skill Profile concepts.
4. Translates Reason/Wrapup Codes and Phonebooks into Aux Codes and Address Books.
